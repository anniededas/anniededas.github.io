	<p>
		For my midterm project, I essentially want to create a site including all the art, music, and film/ photography I like and that inspire me, kinda like my own personal pintrest board but on a website I create. With a grid layout and using things I'm interested in I will make a site that encapsulates my general 'asethetic' withinn those 3 categories. For each webpage for the categories I will also employ a grid layout with pictures/ gifs of the things in that category. For the Music page I want to include songs that play when you click on certain elements that connect to that song/ artist. I might also include links in some of the pictures/ gifs in the otherr two categories that take you to the artist's website or a link to the movie trailer. I also want to include a footer that has links to relevant socials like my spotify, and a link to the homepage of the site/ my class site.
