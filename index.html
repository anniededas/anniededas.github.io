		<h2>"As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush</h2>

		<p>In Vannevar Bush's "As We May Think" he expresses his belief that the growth of technology will make knowledge more abundant and accessible for most people. Since the article was written in july of 1945, he seemed to be looking into the future when he expressed this sentiment, and he couldn't have been more right. As technology like cameras, recording devices, and computer systems expanded people began to have access to knowledge that they never could've before. Today everyone uses technolgy as it's extremely accessible and we can connect with each other simultaneously through text messages and social media. The internet is used for every aspect of our lives, contacting family, professional environments, school, and for entertainment to name a few.</p>

		<h2>"Long Live the Web" by Tim Burners Lee</h2>

		<p>For me, the two biggest themes throughout this article are universality and accessibility. The Web wouldn't be the Web without everyone being able to get on it and make their own connections. This makes the Web one of the greatest innovations mankind has created and has made the Web the well of knowledge it is today. Anyone with a device that can connect to the internet has access to the Web and can therefore make a website, and link that website to others without restrictions. This is why net neutrality is important, the Web wouldn't be what it is today with restrictions and laws patroling the Web and restricting what we can post or access. </p>
